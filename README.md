# Cloning a Repository with Sparse Checkout

> **Sparse checkout** allows you to clone a repository and only check out the files and folders relevant to your work. This approach is especially useful when working with large repositories where you need only a specific subset of the content.

---

## 🚀 When to Use Sparse Checkout

- **📂 Large Repositories:** Avoid downloading unnecessary files.
- **🔍 Focused Development:** Work on only the project parts you need.
- **⚡ Faster Clones:** Reduce clone time by skipping full file checkout.

---

## 📌 Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository Without Checking Out Files

Clone the repository with a partial history. The `--filter=blob:none` option prevents downloading file content, and the `--no-checkout` flag stops Git from immediately populating your working directory.

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --no-checkout https://github.com/NITHINKR06/CyberSecurity.git
cd CyberSecurity

```

### 2️⃣ Initialize Sparse Checkout in Cone Mode
Enable sparse checkout with "cone" mode to simplify pattern matching by focusing on top-level directories.

```bash
git sparse-checkout init --cone
```

### 3️⃣ Set the Desired Folder
Configure sparse checkout to include only the folder you need. Replace folderName with the actual directory you wish to work with.

```bash
git sparse-checkout set folderName
```

### 4️⃣ Checkout the Desired Branch
Check out the specific branch (e.g., main) to load the selected folder into your working directory.

```bash
git checkout main
```
